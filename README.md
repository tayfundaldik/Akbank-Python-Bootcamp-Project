# Akbank-Python-Bootcamp-Project
This project is about library management system.
  I checked the inputs for commands in the menu. Then checked inputs of book name, author name, release year, and number of pages. User cannot enter digits or special characters for author name or cannot enter letters for releaase year and number of pages. If library has 2 or more of the same books, user can delete one of them. Thanks for everything Global AI hub and Akbank!!!
